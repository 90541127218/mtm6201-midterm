        <h1>Making Online Shopping Easier and Rewarding for Filipinos</h1>
        <p>Online shopping has become increasingly popular in the Philippines in recent years, with more and more Filipinos turning to e-commerce platforms to purchase a wide range of products and services. This trend is not going away as more and more Filipinos are adapting to the technology. To keep up with the increasing demands, we designed a feature that would provide Filipinos with more rewarding and accessible ways to fund their shopping experience.</p>

            <h2>OVERARCHING PROBLEM</h2>
            <p>While e-commerce is growing rapidly in the Philippines, there are still significant challenges for mid to lower-income households. Limited access to payment options is one of them. Many Filipinos prefer cash-on-delivery payments or often use partner payment centers, e-wallets, and even digital loans for their purchases.</p>

        <div class="works-row">  
            <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>The challenge was to design an e-wallet top up feature that: Allows the users to top up their e-wallet account conveniently and with ease, has a provision for other payment options, is compatible with the user baseâ€™s devices (based on analytics, our users use older mobile devices), would comply with regulations and relevant laws </p>

    <div class="header2">
        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>The team collaborated with the business stakeholders, development team, and with our official online shopping partner to gather the requirements. We identified what were the basic features to develop for MVP. The goal was to release this feature prior to the high season. (4th quarter of 2023).</p>
